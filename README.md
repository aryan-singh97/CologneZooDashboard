# Project Documentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Recommended version: LTS)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Starting the Development Server

To start the development server and run your Nuxt.js application locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

By default, your application will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Stopping the Development Server

To stop the development server, press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal.

## Testing

### Running Tests

Unit tests, end-to-end tests, or any other tests related to your Nuxt.js application can be executed using your preferred testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha, Cypress). Ensure that your tests are appropriately configured and located within your project directory.

```bash
# Example: Running Jest tests
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```

## Building for Production

### Building the Application

To build your Nuxt.js application for production deployment:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This command generates optimized JavaScript and CSS files in the `.nuxt` directory.

### Starting the Production Server

Once you've built your application, you can start the production server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

Your application will be served at the configured port for production use.

## Additional Commands

### Linting

To lint your project files using ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
```

### Cleaning Up

To clean up the built assets:

```bash
npm run clean
# or
yarn clean
```

This command removes the `.nuxt` directory.

## Configuration

You can configure various aspects of your Nuxt.js application in the `nuxt.config.js` file. Refer to the official Nuxt.js documentation for more details on available configuration options.

## Deployment

Ensure that you have set up your deployment environment properly according to your hosting provider's requirements. Typically, you'll need to upload your built assets to a server and configure your server to serve the application.
